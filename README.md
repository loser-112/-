Summary of Our Approach
We have developed a system named "LiGanJianYing" for liver cancer detection and personalized treatment recommendations. This system leverages advanced deep learning technologies and multimodal data processing methods. Below is a summary of our approach and steps:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Collection:

Collect a large dataset of liver cancer CT images, including normal liver images and images with liver cancer lesions.
Collect clinical data, including patient age, gender, medical history, etc.
Data Preprocessing:

Standardize, denoise, and resample CT images.
Process 3D CT images into 2D slices.
Standardize and encode clinical data, handle missing values and outliers.
2. Liver Segmentation
Liver Segmentation using U-Net:
Build and train a U-Net model to segment the liver portion in CT images.
Use data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data, such as rotation, flipping, and cropping.
3. Liver Cancer Detection and Segmentation
Liver Cancer Detection using Transformer:
After segmenting the liver using the U-Net model, input the segmented results into a Transformer model for liver cancer lesion detection.
Build and train the Transformer model to extract global features and improve detection accuracy.
4. Clinical Data and Doctor Input Processing
Processing Clinical Data and Doctor Inputs using BERT:
Preprocess clinical data and doctor inputs to a format that can be handled by the BERT model.
Extract clinical features and doctor input features as additional supervisory information.
5. Feature Fusion
Fusing Image Features, Clinical Features, and Doctor Input Features:
Construct a feature fusion function to combine the extracted image features, clinical features, and doctor input features, generating a comprehensive feature vector.
6. Building and Training the Fusion Model
Building the Fusion Model:

Construct a fusion model to handle the comprehensive feature vector and generate final personalized treatment recommendations.
Use a deep neural network (DNN) as the base structure for the fusion model.
Training the Fusion Model:

Use the fused features and labeled data to train the fusion model, improving model accuracy and robustness.
7. Self-Distillation Process
Self-Distillation:
Use a teacher model and a student model; the teacher model leverages more features and complex structures, while the student model learns from the teacher model through the distillation process.
Use a distillation loss function to train the student model with the teacher modelâ€™s outputs as soft targets.
8. Generating Final Output
Generating Personalized Treatment Recommendations:
Use the trained fusion model to generate personalized treatment recommendations, integrating image features, clinical features, and doctor input features to provide scientific and reasonable treatment plans.

Summary
Through these steps, we have developed an advanced liver cancer detection and personalized treatment recommendation system that fully utilizes multimodal data, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment. This system not only automatically identifies and segments the liver but also provides personalized treatment recommendations based on multimodal data, demonstrating significant technological innovation and broad application prospects.
